    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Erika and this is a website I made during Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program. Over the years, I have been trying to improve this page. I wanted this website to spread the awareness of mental health. 
      I hope this website can help people gain a new insight and help them support the ones close to them.</p>
